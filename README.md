# Ravana

*In the past, I watched my kingdom burn, blinded by love, allowing the woman I loved the most, cherished to wreak havoc as she pleased. I was wrong; I was foolish, a king undone by passion. But from the ashes of my folly, I rise anew, vowing to build a fortress of order and prosperity. With this I shall ensure that my world thrives, not perishes. Let every treasure be accounted for, and let no flame ever threaten our legacy again.*
